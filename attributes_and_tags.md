### Tags and Attributes

Tags are used to organize works and bookmarks. They are bits of data creators add to their creations, to help themselves and others find their work. Tags can also be used to provide meta-commentary, like Tumblr's "whisper tags". An admin might create tag types such as:

- Pairing
- Trope
- Character
- Background Character
- Background Pairing

It's important to note that for any given installation of Ourchive, each tag category may have thousands of tags associated with it. These are meant to be verbose and flexible.

Attributes are used to categorize works, bookmarks, chapters, and users. Attributes are meant to be a more limited range of options, with a focus on community-wide concepts and "must-have" information. An admin might create attribute types such as:

- Rating
- Warning
- Category
- Genre

Attributes have specific logic associated with them. Admins can specify if an attribute type can be multi-select or not; it might make sense to let creators assign multiple genres to their work, but not multiple ratings. Additionally, admins can limit attribute types to a specific object; some attributes might apply to bookmarks and works but not users, or chapters but not works or bookmarks.

When Ourchive loads attributes for users, it will load all associated values. If you find yourself with more than 15 attribute values per type, that might be a sign that your attribute type should really be a tag type.
