### Email
By default, Ourchive uses [anymail](https://github.com/anymail/django-anymail) with [mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) to send email. Anymail can be configured for a number of different hosting providers by editing settings.py. Making email configuration easier and minimally necessary is a roadmap item for Ourchive 1.0.
