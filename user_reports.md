# User Reporting

Ourchive users can report bad behavior to an admin. Upon creation of the report, anyone marked as an admin will receive an email alerting them to a new report.

In the admin console, reports are sorted by resolve status and update date. Details from the reporting user are available. Admins can add a note and resolve the report.

User report reasons should be configured as part of install. We recommend simple, broad reasons. All reasons will be shown to the user when they make a report, so remember: don't add 50 different choices!

Resolving the report must be done manually e.g. by temporarily deactivating the offending account or emailing the relevant users. Reports are expected to be very low volume during Ourchive's MVP phase, so functionality is limited.
